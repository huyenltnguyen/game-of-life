# Build the Game of Life
**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/reGdqx/.
#### User stories:
  1. When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
  2. I can start and stop the board.
  3. I can set up the board.
  4. I can clear the board.
  5. When I press start, the game will play out.
  6. Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
